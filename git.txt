git add filename

To remove a file from staging area

git rm --cached filename

While working with online repo in GitHub to avoid logging in multiple times we use one time setup

ssh-keygen -o

and press enter for everything don't give any value
a ssh folder will be created navigate to that folder cd .ssh
open id_rsa.pub file use cat id_rsa.pub
copy the key and go to GitHub settings click add new ssh, give a name and paste it

To push files from local to remote repository

git push origin main
	   |-> url

--> We use tag to maintain the versions of the code

git tag v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"

To push the tag into GitHub: git push origin v1.o

To download or clone a project

git clone "https link in GitHub"

To create a new branch

git checkout -b brach_name

To switch between branches
git switch feature1

---> While creating branches if we use checkout we have use
git checkout -b feature1
---> If we want to use switch
git switch -c feature2

---> git branch: gives all the local branches
---> git branch --all gives all the branches including remote ones
---> git branch -d feature2: deletes the branch feature2
---> To merge two branches we use: git merge feature2, we have to be on the main branch to merge
